Homework 1 Submission  
1. Can you compute the TF.IDF of the entire corpus? Why or why not?  
TF.IDF can be computed for the entire corpus but it will take a lot of time to compute as the number of words will be too high.  
  
2. How can you limit the number of terms to check?  
The number of terms can be limited by the following techniques:  
a) Removing the STOPWORDS i.e. the common english words  
b) Stemming the words. For example, converting changes to change  
c) Removing the punctuations.  
d) Converting the whole text to lower case.  
e) Removing numbers from the text.   
f) Setting the threshold for word length   
  
3. If you removed and/or modified terms of the original corpus, how did you do so?  
In this problem I,  
a) Removed the STOPWORDS.  
b) Removed the punctuations.  
c) Converted the text to lower case.  
d) Removed the numbers from the text.   
e) Allowed words with minimum word length of 3.  
  
4. Visualization  
To visualize the data I created a word cloud for any particular document.  
The word cloud contains 5 most relevant words for that document.
